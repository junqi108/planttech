# Outline

The following include the process to extract the `Leaf Inclination Angle` (LIA) with respect to zenith, the `Leaf Area Index` (LAI), and the `Leaf Area Density` (LAD) of a point cloud (PC). We test our pipeline using a mockup point cloud generated in `Blensor` software. This process is outlined below:

- **LiDAR simulation on mockup trees with BLENSOR**
    - Toy tree and sensor specifications
    - Data structure
    - Leaf Inclination Angle (LIA) estimation
    - Leaf Area Density (LAD) estimation
  
- **Aplication on Kiwkifruit LiDAR dataset**
    - Kiwifruit MLS LiDAR data structure
    - Leaf Inclination Angle (LIA) estimation
    - Leaf Area Density (LAD) estimation
